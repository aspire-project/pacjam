debsecan (0.4.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * The default data source URL has been switched to
    <https://security-tracker.debian.org/>.  In addition, debsecan now
    performs proper server certificate checks for https:// URLs.  This
    functionality can be switched off with the new --disable-https-check
    option.
